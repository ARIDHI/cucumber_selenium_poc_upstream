    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up JDK 11
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          java-version: '11'
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean package
        env:
          JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
      - name: Run Cucumber tests
        run: mvn test 
        env:
